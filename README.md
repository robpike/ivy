Ivy is an interpreter for an APL-like language. It is a plaything and a work in
progress.

Ivy has a custom domain. Do not install using github directly. Instead, run:
	```
	go get robpike.io/ivy
	```

Documentation at http://godoc.org/robpike.io/ivy.
Try the demo:
	```
	cd demo; go run demo.go
	```

Prototype apps for iPhone, iPad, and Android are available in the App store and Google Play store.
To find them, search for "ivy bignum calculator".

The talk predates a lot of the features, including floating point, text, and user-defined operators.

To be built, ivy requires Go 1.5.
