Ivy is an interpreter for an APL-like language. It is a plaything and a work in
progress.

Ivy has a custom domain. Do not install using github directly. Instead, run:

	go get robpike.io/ivy

Documentation at http://godoc.org/robpike.io/ivy.

Try the demo:

	cd demo; go run demo.go

Prototype apps for iPhone, iPad, and Android are available in the App store and Google Play store.
To find them, search for "ivy bignum calculator".

Video for the talk at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXoG0WX0r_E  
The talk predates a lot of the features, including floating point, text, and user-defined operators.

To be built, ivy requires Go 1.5.
