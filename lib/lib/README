This directory contains source code for loadable ivy libraries. Run
"go generate" in the parent directory to embed them in the ivy
binary.

Each file should start with a comment that introduces the library.
The text of that comment will be shown by the ivy special command,

	)lib doc <library-name>

The code in the library will not be executed until the user says,

	)lib <library-name>

Within the library, commands such as

	)prec 1024

will affect execution of all code after the library is loaded.

Ops and variables beginning with _ are ignored in the documentation.
